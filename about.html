                      Hi! I am Jed. I am currently a student at BCIT, taking the Computer Information Technology Diploma Program. I am originally from the Philippines. where I got my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Few months after I graduated, my family and I moved to British Columbia, Canada. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I got into programming because of my fascination of computers even when I was still a kid. I remember back then when I was still very young, my father bought me and my brother a V-Tech computer. It had so many things on it and not just games. One particular application in that computer that got my interest is BASIC. My brother was the first one to try it. He grabbed the manual and typed in the sample code from the manual and ran his program. I was so amazed that I got into it immediately. That was my first experience programming.        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my time in school back in the Philippines, I have made a couple of projects. One of which is a program, written in C#, that solves the <a href="https://neos-guide.org/content/diet-problem" target="_blank">Diet Problem </a> using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm" target="_blank">Simplex Algorithm </a> given user input constraints. It was an individual project and the most challenging project I did at that time. Another is a group project where we need to create web application for our school library. The objective was to make an computerized system that can be used by the school library. We made the frontend using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZK_(framework)" target="_blank">ZK Framework</a> and used Java and Apache Server for the backend. It was the first project that introduced me to the Model-View-Controller design pattern. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I decided to go back to school and take the Computer Information Technology program because I wanted to expand my knowledge in the area of computer technology and not just in the field of programming. I have learned a lot in the two terms that I have studied at BCIT that I haven't learned when I was in the Philippines. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       At BCIT, I learned UX/UI where I realized that it is not all how the website looks, but also how easy it is to use. I also understood networking more because it was taught more in depth compared to when I was still in the Philippines.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am very enthusiastic programmer and I'm always excited to learn new things. I consider programming as one of my strengths. I like the challenge of solving hard programming problems, and I like the satisfaction when I do solve them. I'm also fascinated in how from a blank piece of file, you just type in small pieces of code and run it, and little by little you add more things to it and you see your program grow. You can control how it is structured and how it behaves. Because of that, I treat programming as an art.
                    </p>
